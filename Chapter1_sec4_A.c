->MOV
  -Instruction(指令) for data transfer 数据传输 (0:14)
  -
->We should introduce the development  enviroment (开发环境) before introducing the instruction set 指令集 (0:36)
  -ADS 1.2 (1:04)
    -Really important about isntall directory (2:22)
    -Need to install in "C:\Program Files\ARM\" as 64 bit (3:03)
    -Install license (4:53)
    -*.asf is the executable file in arm (11:05)
    -ADS 1.2 helps us to learn the ARM assemly in the easy way (12:05)
    -It lists the CPU state as 
      -Current (当前)
        -CPSR determine the current state (当前) by the lowest 5 bits (12:39) from M5 to M0
