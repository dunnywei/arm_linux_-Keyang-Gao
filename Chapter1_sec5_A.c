->USB to RS232 connnector (0:24)
  -Reciever and transmitter (0:34)
  -So you need to go to the system control->Device Driver->COM AND LPT
    -Then you will see "COM4" in this case (1:16)
    -Use a terminal which will match as line 7 as "COM4" in this case (1:41)
    -baud rate=115200. It means it can sends 115200 bit per second (bps) (1:52)
      -unit is in 比特位 (2:00)= 115200/8 can be transmitted 传送 in 字节 (2:02)
