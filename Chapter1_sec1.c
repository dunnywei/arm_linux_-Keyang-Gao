Unit 1->ARM register, ARM CPU mode, ARM assembly, 

Unit 2->External hardware and device driver

Clock->Memory, Flash, port, data sheet, manual

Unit 3->ARM boot loader

Like BIOS
-Boot->like the embedded board to intialized by the minimum hardware enviroment (4:57)
-loader->Let the OS(Linux/Android) inside the flash/hard drive (5:17) into the RAM (5:44)
and redy to execute (5:49)
-U_boot->open source (6:14). They are using tiny-210 development board (6:49) based on ARM 
cortex A8 (1GHz) (@7:48)

Unit 4->ARM interrupt programming (@8:02)
-Software interrupt
-Hardware interrupt(@8:14)
-U must know the interrupt bofore going to the OS. Otherwise, it won't help(@8:26)
-When there is a context switch(切换) required for swapping out one process running on the CPU. It requires
interrupt(@8:42)
