->USB to RS232 connnector (0:24)
  -Reciever and transmitter (0:34)
  -So you need to go to the system control->Device Driver->COM AND LPT
    -Then you will see "COM4" in this case (1:16)
    -Use a terminal which will match as line 7 as "COM4" in this case (1:41)
    -baud rate=115200. It means it can sends 115200 bit per second (bps) (1:52)
      -unit is in 比特位 (2:00)= 115200/8 can be transmitted 传送 in 字节 (2:02)

    -Databits->In each 8 bits= a data packet (数据包) (2:08)
    -Stop bit->after sending the 8 bits 比特位, we will send a stop 停止 bit 位/标志 (2:12)
    -parity check 奇偶校验 (2:18)
->When system starts, it boots from U-Boot (2:43) or boot loader like the one in BIOS (2:47)
->type "help" to what command line does the system board support (2:59)
      -This is boots from SD card (3:11)
      -I can also choose the boot from NAND flash as well (3:18)
      -Treat NAND flash like a hard disk(256 兆 MB) where linux sysetem is installed (3:22) and 线程(thread)/进程(process) (3:23) 
      browsing 浏览 (3:23)
      -using pwd->it will list where which direcotory 目录 you are in 
      -type pwd and result is "/" it means you are in root directory (根目录) (4:05)
      -After starting the linux on the target board, I can send the elf executable to the linux board (4:17)
      -using "~" to boot 启动 from bootloader (4:31)(??)
        -Whenn boot 启动 from bootlaoder only, it can't execute ELF file (4:35)
